Dear reader!

This zip-file is meant to be included into your python path:
- as whole folder ("GroupB DataScience Project AllFiles") to make sure the pathing in the notebook still works.

In case the files aren't working, all basic data is retrieved from github:
https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis
and was not renamed; as such, it should be easy to retrieve the data yourself.
The dataframe used for the models are identical to the output of the first part "Preprocessing".


Notes regarding the notebook:
We tried to label the variables in the dataframe for the models as clearly as possible, however, we also added a .txt file "Project_B_Variable_Description".
The chapters in the notebook are numbered and formatted with headers, to increase navigating.
The notebook was written in JupyterLab (using JupyterLab will thus allow the same visuals we saw when handing in the project) 
- however, other ways of opening the file should work just as well.

Enjoy the notebook and our findings!
